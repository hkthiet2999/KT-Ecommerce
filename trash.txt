Do the following to trigger the gitignore

Step 1: Commit all your pending changes in the repo which you want to fix and push that.

Step 2: Now you need to remove everything from the git index in order to refresh your git repository. This is safe. Use this command:

`git rm -r --cached .`
Step 3: Now you need to add everything back into the repo, which can be done using this command:

`git add .`
Step 4: Finally you need to commit these changes, using this command:

`git commit -m "Gitignore issue fixed"`
